Simple splash page website composed of AngularJS experiments

This simple splash page design is borrowed from recent work with the Adobe creative team, and expanded into a playground for JavaScript experiments with AngularJS. The page includes a number of subtle features, which you can see if you explore the code.

Features include:

- Dynamic background image implementation (capable of evaluating screen size to determine required image size).
- Dynamic header menu based on JSON (handy for swapping out navigation schemes during experimentation).
- Dynamic page content generated from HTML templates (content can be defined based on screen size).
- Custom contact form inculding simple validation and PHP backend.
