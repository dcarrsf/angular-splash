# angular-splash
Simple splash page website composed of AngularJS experiments

This splash page design is based on recent work with the Adobe creative team, and expanded into a playground for JavaScript experiments with AngularJS. The page includes a number of subtle features, which you can see if you explore the code.

**Things to note:**

- Dynamic background image (image size can be based on screen size).
- Dynamic header menu with JSON (handy for swapping out navigation schemes during experimentation).
- Dynamic page content from HTML templates (content can be defined based on screen size).
- Custom contact form inculding simple validation and PHP backend (convenient on devices).
